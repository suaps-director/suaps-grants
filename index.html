                The Society for UAP Studies is expanding its commitment to the field by taking on a new and proactive role as both a grants ideas incubation and development resource, as well as a grant-issuing institution. Our mission is to accelerate rigorous, interdisciplinary research and to empower the next generation of researchers in this critical domain. We believe that by fostering a community of practice and providing both administrative and developmental support, we can help transform compelling ideas into impactful, grant-ready projects that can potentially be funded by the Society and its committed donors.

                            Given the relative youth of our emerging field—UAP Studies—this dual approach helps foster discipline and maturity where traditional academic institutions might be more hesitant and conservative in their support. We therefore offer more than just a grants application cycle; we are a partner in the research process. Our dedicated team provides a resource for the research community, offering guidance and assistance to help develop concepts and initial research questions into fully formed, grant-ready proposals. Our aim is to work collaboratively with researchers to strengthen their ideas, ensuring they are well-defined, methodologically sound, and aligned with our shared goals.

                            We also function as a formal grant-issuing institution, managing the administrative and financial aspects of the awards. We provide structured support and oversight to ensure project compliance, fiscal responsibility, and timely execution of research activities.

                    To guide projects from inception to completion, we have established two basic modes for our research and administration model that ensures accountability, quality, and long-term value.

                            This mode, detailed under our existing initiatives, focuses on the careful administration of individual grants. Once a proposal has been developed and successfully received by the Society, we enter into the AURA administrative process, which sees research grants through a well-defined (but flexible) lifecycle. Here, we provide the necessary administrative and financial infrastructure to support the project's Principal Investigators (PIs) and their teams, ensuring a smooth and successful project deployment.

                            Following the completion of individual projects, we may enter into an optional second mode of research. Here, in partnership with the research affiliates whose projects successfully worked through AURA, the Society as an institution takes on a higher-level research role, looking for emergent patterns and interdisciplinary relationships among the completed projects and their datasets. This cross-projects research model is designed to:

                            <li>**Generate New Theory:** Work to either a) apply a variety of theoretical frameworks to help guide the search for connections, or b) identify patterns in the data and then seek theoretical explanations for them.</li>

                            This optional phase provides a unique opportunity for project PIs and team members to continue their work with the Society, engaging in real, institution-level interdisciplinary research that seeks to advance the entire field.

                    As is to be expected, like any other grant-issuing institution, grant awards offered by the Society are always subject to the availability of funding, and calls for grant proposals (CFPs) do not in themselves guarantee that availability. As the Society builds trust and reliable engagement with the community, we hope to establish a sustainable funding cycle that can support the Society’s grants initiative.

                            These are gifts made to the Society by donors for use by specific grant-seeking projects. This enables the creation of donor-directed research grants (DDRGs), where the donor specifies the project or area of research they wish to fund through their restricted gift to the Society. This allows for direct collaboration with our partners in supporting specific, high-priority research. To date, the Society has worked with the Baltic Sea Anomaly Project and the projects of the private group SeaQR, to facilitate DDRGs made possible by the generous support provided by donors.

                            These are funds awarded to the Society by donors for distribution to our portfolio of grant proposals at our discretion. Donors are attracted by the curated portfolio of proposals that we present, but allow the Society to determine which projects are awarded funding. To ensure the highest ethical standards and to avoid any conflicts of interest, gifts of this sort will be directed toward grants awarded by an independent and external grants award committee. This committee will evaluate proposals based on merit, originality, and alignment with the Society’s mission. The results of this evaluation will be submitted to the grants development and administration department director and, in final consultation with the executive leadership of the Society, award determinations will be made and grants disbursed in accordance with our AURA administrative system.
